## Description
This repository contains the implementations of splitfed learning and performance evaluations under IID, imbalanced and non-IID data distribution settings. It also has the code used for Raspberry Pi implementation. For the split learning and federated learning implementations, refer to above link "github project for SRDS 2020".
